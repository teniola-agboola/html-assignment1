                <h1>Biography</h1>
                <p>Hello! My name is Oluwateniola Agboola and I am an aspiring cloud engineer studying at AltSchool’s School of Engineering, Cloud Engineering Department. My journey into technology was sparked by my fascination with how systems store, manage, and process massive amounts of data in the cloud.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’ve always been curious about how platforms like Google Drive or AWS function behind the scenes, enabling seamless access to resources anywhere in the world. Joining AltSchool has provided me with the opportunity to explore this field deeply and to develop the skills needed to work in the ever-evolving cloud industry.

                </p>
                <p>
                    When I’m not immersed in learning, I enjoy music, exploring tech blogs, and working on small personal projects to experiment with new tools and technologies.
